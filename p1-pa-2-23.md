### PCAP1_2.pcap Analysis

Going through the packets in PCAP1_2.pcap, I noticed a mix of local network discovery traffic (like mDNS and ICMPv6) along with some DNS and TCP/TLS activity that stood out. The main activity I saw was that the computer was trying to connect to `google.com`. 

Here’s what I found and how I figured it out:

1. Normally, when opening a website, the sequence follows this order: DNS resolution, to, TCP handshake, to, TLS handshake, to, encrypted HTTP request and response.

2. In this capture, however, I didn’t see the full handshake sequence because the recording started mid-session. That’s why some TCP packets (port 443) appear before the DNS queries — those were already-active HTTPS connections.

3. After that, there were several DNS requests where the device tried to resolve google.com.

4. At first, I saw a few “No such name” responses for domains like google.com.hsd1.ca.comcast.net, which are DNS “NXDOMAIN” (non-existent domain) replies. This means extra lookups occurred before the request finally resolved to the actual google.com domain. This usually happens because the ISP automatically appends its own domain suffixes, based on how the DNS resolver’s search list is configured.

5. Eventually, the device successfully resolved the actual google.com domain, and the client continued sending or receiving encrypted TLS “Application Data,” which represents the actual web content.


#### Conclusion

Based on the DNS and HTTPS patterns, the specific activity captured in PCAP1_2.pcap was **the user opening Google.com in a web browser**. The other packets are just regular background noise from the local network.

### PCAP1_3.pcap Analysis

Going through the packets in PCAP1_3.pcap, I found that the main activity captured here was a traceroute to Google’s IPv6 address. The packets show a clear pattern of ICMPv6 echo requests and replies that help map the route from Alex's computer to the destination.

Here’s what I found and how I figured it out:

1. The capture includes multiple **ICMPv6 Echo Request** packets with gradually increasing hop limits. This pattern is typical of a traceroute, which tests each hop along the path by incrementing the hop limit (similar to TTL in IPv4). For example, the packets with **hop limit = 13** were the final probes, meaning the traceroute was testing the thirteenth hop.

2. The destination address seen in the packets (`2607:f8b0:4005:80e::200e`) belongs to Google’s IPv6 network. The replies to Alex's Echo Requests are **ICMPv6 Echo Replies**, not “Time Exceeded” messages. This confirms that the probe packets actually reached the final destination—Google’s server—rather than stopping at an intermediate router (like, drop the packet before rreaching the server), in other words, the traceroute successfully reached Google after about **13 hops**.
3. The replies have a **hop limit of 115**, which indicates Google’s server started with a default hop limit (likely 128) and about 13 hops were used to reach back to Alex's computer.

4. Additionally, the reason multiple request–reply pairs share the same hop limit is because traceroute sends **several probes per hop** (often three) to measure latency consistency and packet loss.

#### Conclusion

The capture represents an **IPv6 traceroute to Google**, where Alex's computer sent multiple ICMPv6 Echo Requests with increasing hop limits to map the path. The destination was reached successfully at **hop 13**, meaning there were approximately 13 hops between Alex's device and Google’s IPv6 server.
